### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tom and I have 20+ years of experience in IT. I was working in many areas of software development, as a consultant and
a team member in small and large companies an one corporation. I have background with backend (PHP, Behat, Symfony, Laravel), admin (GitLab, Zabbix, Ubuntu, RedHat) and devops (AWS, Chef) role, embedded systems (C, Atmel) and a little frontend (HTML, CSS, JS).

Now, I'm working as a freelancer and a member of small company in cozy town.

Currently I am not actively looking for a job, but I am open for proposals :).
Due to family restrictions I consider only fully-remote job offers.

I run a Polish translation of Leo Babauta's blog [mnmlista](https://github.com/tjadowski/mnmlista.pl).

I collect useful (for me) tips & tricks [here](https://github.com/tjadowski/tjadowski/blob/master/TODAY-I-LEARNT.md).

I blog on personal topics (in Polish) at [NotesOffline](https://mnmlista.pl/offline).

You can reach me at [jadowski@protonmail.com](mailto:jadowski@protonmail.com).
